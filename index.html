    Two names your average Briton has never encountered, and their influence on British society remains minimal despite being correct time after time. Peter, originally an atheist Trotskyite turned Protestant Conservative for the last few decades has correctly predicted the crises and breakdown of communities post 1970, while Jacob, the MP for North-East Somerset is perhaps the only MP who is willing to stand by his values and personal beliefs no matter the cost to his political career - recently as we have seen perhaps extremely damaging amid 'gotcha!' assaults regarding his views on the sanctity of life being enshrined at the moment of conception. The calm and reasoned manner in which he will adress each angry point that is spat in his direction nafter being interrupted <!--LINKS HERE PLEASE!!--> are testamement to his excellent elocution. <p> Patient and open, yet stalwart in their beliefs- traits in a potential cabinet member or prime minister that have been lacking in recent years. The friendship he formed with fellow MP <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMQLSkM1_sU" target="_blank">Jess Phillips</a> whom he termed 'everyone's favourite socialist' who herself stated 'I was raised to always hate tories' is further proof of his friendly, open nature and love of thoughtful debate no matter political differences.

      It is therefore high time that young libertarian people (myself included) rise up and applaud their efforts - two <b>beacons of reason</b> and <b>fact over feeling </b> so desperately needed as figureheads in British politics, so that the government can see that people want honesty, integrity and character in their politicians rather than empty suits that will say anything to get elected that inevitably leads to broken promises and the feeling that the people do not have a say in the running of the country.
